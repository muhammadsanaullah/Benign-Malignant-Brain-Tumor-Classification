# Benign-Malignant-Breast-Tumor-Classification
Comparative analysis of classification algorithms in Machine Learning to classify benign and malignant breast tumors in MRI scans.

Breast Tumor data found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarahvch/breast-cancer-wisconsin-prognostic-data-set 

The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and tested:

1. k nearest neighbor
2. logistic regression
3. support vector machines (SVM)
4. decision trees
5. gradient boosted decision trees
6. na√Øve Bayes classifiers
7. neural networks
8. random forests

Accuracy metrics include: cross validation, 100 repetition epochs, average classification accuracy metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score,
and roc_auc values, when applicable.
